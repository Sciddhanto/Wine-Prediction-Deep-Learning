# Wine Prediction Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project uses a deep learning model to predict the type of wine based on its chemical properties. It demonstrates how machine learning can classify wines into different types using their chemical attributes.

## Features
- Processes and normalizes wine data for model training.
- Builds a deep learning model with multiple layers for classification.
- Evaluates performance using metrics like accuracy and visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset contains chemical properties of wines, such as alcohol, acidity, and more, labeled by their type (e.g., Red or White).

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the deep learning model.
- **NumPy**: For handling numerical data.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
